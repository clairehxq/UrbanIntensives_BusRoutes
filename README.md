# Description
Exploring bus ridership in NYC’s outer boroughs, specifically, the impact of taxis on bus ridership. This research can inform better bus route planning that is responsive to ridership patterns.  
 
# Background
- NYC’s Bus Ridership has been slowly declining 
- While other forms of transportation have risen:
- Between 2010 and 2015, 46 million fewer bus trips were taken annually 
- 159 million more subway rides were taken annually 
- 190k more bike trips taken annually 
- The research has also been concentrated mostly on the borough of Manhattan 
(concentrated mostly on the borough of Manhattan)

# Methodlogies
- Collect pick-up and drop-off locations for each ride
- Divide boroughs into grids so that each pickup and drop-off location could fall into a particular grid
- Look at popular cab / uber routes based on the grids: clustering
- See if there are any bus routes that can be improved by looking at popular cab / uber routes: nearest neighbor
